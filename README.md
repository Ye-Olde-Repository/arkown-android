The name "ArkOwn" is a play-on-words of the acronym "RCON", the word "archon", and the gamer term "own".
 - RCON (Remote CONtrol) is the protocol used to control many popular first-person-shooter (FPS) game servers.
 - Archon was the ancient Greek political title used for the rulers of Greek tribes.
 - Own (or "pwn" [sic]) is the colloquial gamer term used to describe something exemplary or skillfully dominating.

Thank you for your interest and support!

Sincerely,
